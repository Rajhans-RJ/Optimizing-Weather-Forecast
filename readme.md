## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- An API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd weather-forecast
   ```
3. Open `rj.js` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```javascript
   const apikey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
   ```
4. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## 🖼️ Customizing Background Images

To use your own background images:

1. Replace the URLs in the `backgroundImages` array in `rj.js` with your preferred image URLs.
2. Ensure your images are freely usable or that you have the necessary rights.

```javascript
const backgroundImages = [
    'path/to/your/image1.jpg',
    'path/to/your/image2.jpg',
    // Add more image paths as needed
];
```

> **Note:** Please ensure you have the right to use any images you include in the project. The current images are from Pexels and are free to use, but you should replace them with your own or properly attributed images for a published project.
